    This website displays data about Open Era men's and women's tennis in a user-friendly format. The goal is to include data going back to 1968, but
    given the volume of the data, please be patient. New features will be introduced as often as possible. Suggestions are welcome!

  <div>
    I have tried to gather data from the most reliable sources, including the official ATP and WTA websites. However, please note that some data
    (particularly relating to players' coaches as well as data relating to older events) may be inaccurate or incomplete - please let me know if you
    find any issues. Moreover, players' win-loss index and stats are based solely on their singles matches as, even where available, stats for doubles
    matches often do not break out the individual players' stats. All stats are drawn from matches where stats are available online.
